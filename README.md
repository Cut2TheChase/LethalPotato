Ever wanted to play the most anxiety-inducing game of Hot Potato? Well now you can! - A mod for Lethal Company


## What do?
This mod adds a fun lil' scrap item to the game that will begin to slowly deplete in charge after you grab it. If it hits zero, it explodes! 

Is there a way to stop it from depleting so you can get those well deserved credits? You'll have to try to find out~

Check out the Thunderstore mod to get it for yourself [right here!](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/SpudSquad/LethalPotato/)
